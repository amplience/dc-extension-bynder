# Bynder FAQs

## Configuration

- Q. Can I set a minimum/maximum number of Assets that can be added to a Content Item?

A. Yes. This can be set in the Content Type Schema in the object. This is only configurable for MultiSelect as SingleSelect and SingleSelectFile will only permit one Asset.

- Q. Can I add/remove the toolbar in Bynder?

A. Yes. The toolbar can be added or removed by amending this setting in the Bynder Config under the extensions's Installation Parameters.

- Q. Can I select a Language?

A. Yes. The language can be selected in the Bynder Config under the extensions's Installation Parameters.

## Usage

- Q. How many Assets can I add to a Content Item?

A. If SingleSelect or SingleSelectFile are set in the Installation Parameters, only one Asset per Content Item can be selected. If MultiSelect is chosen, the minimum and maximum number of Assets that can be added is defined in the Content Type Schema.

- Q. What is the difference between SingleSelect and SingleSelectFile?

A. SingleSelect allows a user to add one Asset to a Content Item. SingleSelectFile does likewise but also offers the choice of assigning different Derivatives image options (for instance Web Image, Mini, Thumbnail, etc.).

- Q. Can I swap Assets?

A. Yes. Locate the Asset you wish to swap and hover over that Asset. You will see a swap icon. Choose the icon and you can replace the preselected Asset with another of your choice. This can be used in any mode function - SingleSelect, SingleSelectFile and MultiSelect.

- Q. Can I reorder Assets in a Content Item?

A. Yes. You can drag-and-drop an Asset from one location to another.

## Hosting

- Q. Can I fork this extension so I have full control?
